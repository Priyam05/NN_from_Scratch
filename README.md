**FullyConnectedNets.ipynb** : Here, we use modular layer design, and use those layers to implement fully-connected networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models we implement several popular update rules.

**Batch Normalization**
We implement batch normalization from scratch, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.

**Dropout**
We implement Dropout and explore its effects on model generalization.
